# SQL project in KwikiPhone Rentals
 In the mobile phone rental business of KwikiPhone Rentals, there exists a SQLite database used to track their inventory of phone models, customers, and rental information. However, they have identified some issues with the database, including incorrect data and inconsistencies between tables. To enhance the long-term integrity of the database, optimization is required. This involves improvements to table structures, data input processes, and relationships to ensure accuracy and consistency of data, while also providing more efficient data management and analysis capabilities.
